## Strategy_1: SMA21 & SMA50

When the shorter-term MA crosses above the longer-term MA, it's a buy signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a golden cross. Meanwhile, when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA, it's a sell signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting down. This is known as a dead/death cross.

## Strategy_2: EMA21 & EMA50

Meanwhile, when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA, it's a sell signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting down. This is known as a dead/death cross.

## Strategy_3: VWAP

long(Buy) when the price is below the VWAP and short(Sell) when the price is above VWAP.

## Strategy_4: RSI

When the RSI indicator crosses 30 on the RSI chart, it is a bullish sign and when it crosses 70, it is a bearish sign. Put another way, one can interpret that RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued. It may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective price pullback. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

## Strategy_5: MACD

The strategy is to buy – or close a short position – when the MACD signal crosses above the zero line, and sell – or close a long position – when the MACD crosses below the zero line.

## Strategy_6: BolingerBands %B

A %B value above 0.5 indicates the closing price is above the upper band, suggesting an overbought market. Conversely, a %B value below 0.5 indicates the closing price is below the lower band, implying an oversold market. A %B value of 0.5 means the closing price is at the middle band or the simple moving average, indicating a neutral market condition.

## Strategy_7: OBV

**OBV hits a new high while the price tests resistance:** bullish divergence, predicting the price will break resistance and surge higher, playing catch-up.
**The price hits a new high while OBV grinds at or below the last resistance level:** bearish divergence, predicting the rally will stall or reverse.
**OBV hits new low while price tests support:** bearish divergence, predicting the price will break support and surge lower, playing catch up.
**The price hits a new low while OBV grinds at or above the last support level:** bullish divergence, predicting the sell-off will stall or reverse.
**OBV matches the price action, higher or lower:** bullish or bearish convergence, depending on direction.

## Strategy_8: ADX

ADX clearly indicates when the trend is gaining or losing momentum. A series of higher ADX peaks means trend momentum is increasing. A series of lower ADX peaks means trend momentum is decreasing.
